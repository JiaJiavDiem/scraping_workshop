Hello Hannes and Astrid, In my project I try to predict whether a project needs extra attention in a week that the project is active based on the collaboration data (messages and documents) in the Teams environment. I think I thought of a nice open datasource to add to my project, namely active traffic information. The link I see with this data, is that in case of big traffic delays on a day that people have appointments, can cause the fact that appointments need to be rescheduled or that people have less time to work on a project than scheduled and probably run behind schedule. I created a Jupyter notebook that reads online traffic information, transforms the json-result to a dataframe and appends the data to a database. For the notebook I use a local database, later on I will use a Azure SQL database for this, which I already tested also in the notebook. Next to that I created a py-file based on this notebook that I scheduled to run for every 5 minutes on my laptop to retrieve data as of September 8th. Later on when the data proofs to be valuable, I will schedule this code on Azure also. With my best regards, Maarten
