Hi Astrid,

Please find enclosed the input for the coming lesson for Hannes Datta. I know the deadline has passed weeks ago, if Hannes is not able to take a look, all fine.

Enclosed is a zip-file with 6 files:
- purpose of the files is to open a SQLite database, scrape a website and write the text of a website to the database. My ultimate goal is to do topic modeling on the content of the websites
- the scraping is 3 layers deep: 1. scrape homepage, 2. open the links on the homepage and scrape these childpages, 3. open links on childpage and scrape the subsequent page 
- I have split the application in 5 python files, so that I can restart a proces at - for example - step 4
- the 6th file is a CSV with websites I want to scrape

If you can send this to Hannes, that would be great. If he does not have time to review, all fine. My intension is just to show how I set this up and maybe he has suggestions how to do this better or in a different way.

Thanks and best,
Chris
